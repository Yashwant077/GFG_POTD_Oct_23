Problem Description: Check whether K-th bit is set or not

Given a number N and a bit number K, check if Kth index bit of N is set or not. A bit is called set if it is 1. Position of set bit '1' should be indexed starting with 0 from LSB side in binary representation of the number.
Note: Index is starting from 0. You just need to return true or false, driver code will take care of printing "Yes" and "No".

Example 1:

Input: 
N = 4
K = 0
Output: 
No
Explanation: 
Binary representation of 4 is 100, in which 0th index bit from LSB is not set. So, return false.
Example 2:

Input: 
N = 4
K = 2
Output: 
Yes
Explanation: 
Binary representation of 4 is 100, in which 2nd index bit from LSB is set. So, return true.
Example 3:

Input: 
N = 500
K = 3
Output: 
No
Explanation: 
Binary representation of 500 is 111110100, in which 3rd index bit from LSB is not set. So, return false.
Your task:
You don't have to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function checkKthbit that takes n and k as parameters and returns either true(if kth bit is set) or false(if kth bit is not set).

Expected Time Complexity: O(1).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9
0 ≤ K ≤ 31
