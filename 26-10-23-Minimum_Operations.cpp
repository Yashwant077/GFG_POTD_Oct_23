Problem Description: Minimum Operations

Given a number N. Find the minimum number of operations required to reach N starting from 0. You have 2 operations available:

Double the number
Add one to the number

Example 1:

Input:
N = 8
Output: 4
Explanation: 
0 + 1 = 1 --> 1 + 1 = 2 --> 2 * 2 = 4 --> 4 * 2 = 8.

Example 2:

Input: 
N = 7
Output: 5
Explanation: 
0 + 1 = 1 --> 1 + 1 = 2 --> 1 + 2 = 3 --> 3 * 2 = 6 --> 6 + 1 = 7.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function minOperation() which accepts an integer N and return number of minimum operations required to reach N from 0.

Expected Time Complexity: O(LogN)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^6
